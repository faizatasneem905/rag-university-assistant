# University Academic Handbook

## 1. Attendance Policy

Students are expected to attend all scheduled lectures, tutorials, labs, and assessments. Regular attendance is essential for academic success.

A minimum attendance rate of 75 percent in each registered course is required to remain eligible for the final examination.

Students whose attendance falls below 75% will not be permitted to sit the final exam unless they have received an officially documented exemption approved by the Academic Committee.

Approved medical leave, university-sponsored competitions, and formally sanctioned academic activities may be excluded from the attendance calculation, provided valid documentation is submitted within five working days.

Attendance records are finalized two weeks before final examinations. Students are responsible for monitoring their attendance status through the student portal.

## 2. Grading System

The university uses the following grading scale:

A: 4.0  
B: 3.0  
C: 2.0  
D: 1.0  
F: 0.0  

Grades are calculated per course and contribute to the cumulative grade point average (CGPA).

---

## 3. Academic Standing

Students must maintain a minimum cumulative GPA (CGPA) of 2.0 to remain in good academic standing.

If a student's CGPA falls below 2.0 at the end of a semester, the student will be placed on Academic Probation for the following semester.

If the CGPA remains below 2.0 for two consecutive semesters, the student will be subject to Academic Suspension for one semester.

Students returning from suspension must achieve a semester GPA of at least 2.5 to continue enrollment.

## 4. Graduation Requirements

To qualify for graduation, students must:

- Complete at least 120 credit hours.
- Maintain a minimum CGPA of 2.0.
- Clear all financial obligations.
- Complete mandatory internship requirements (if applicable to program).

Graduation eligibility is verified by the Registrar’s Office before degree conferral.

## 5. Academic Integrity

All students are expected to uphold the highest standards of academic honesty.

Plagiarism, cheating during examinations, fabrication of data, or unauthorized collaboration are considered academic misconduct.

First violations may result in a failing grade in the course. Severe or repeated violations may lead to suspension or expulsion.

All reported violations are reviewed by the Academic Integrity Committee.

---

## 6. Course Withdrawal Policy

Students may withdraw from a course within the first eight weeks of the semester.

Withdrawn courses will appear on the transcript as “W” and will not affect the CGPA.

Withdrawal after the deadline requires approval from the Academic Committee.

---

## 7. Academic Appeals Process

Students have the right to appeal decisions related to:

- Academic probation
- Academic suspension
- Examination ineligibility due to attendance
- Academic misconduct penalties

Appeals must be submitted within 10 working days of official notification.

The Academic Review Committee evaluates submitted appeals and may request additional documentation.

Decisions made by the Academic Review Committee are final and binding.

Submission of an appeal does not automatically suspend enforcement of the original decision.

---

## 8. Leave of Absence

Students may request a leave of absence for medical, personal, or financial reasons.

Leaves must be approved before the start of the semester.

Time spent on approved leave does not count toward the maximum duration of study.

---

## 9. Maximum Duration of Study

Undergraduate students must complete their degree within 6 academic years.

Extensions require formal approval and documented justification.
